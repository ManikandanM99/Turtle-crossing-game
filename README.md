# Turtle-crossing-game
 Here's a 350-character description:  Turtle Crossing Game is a Python project using Turtle Graphics. Players help a turtle cross a road full of moving cars by using the Up Arrow key. Each crossing increases car speed, making the game progressively harder. The game tracks levels on-screen and displays a game-over message if a car hits the turtle.
